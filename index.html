            The Mahabharata is the bulkiest Epic consisting of 100,000 verses and is divided into 18 paravas (books).
            This book is usually assigned to Rishi Ved Vyas,
            but scholars have expressed doubts if such a great work could have been accomplished by one single person. 
            Hopkins believes that it was composed by not one person, nor even by one generation, but by several. 
            Mahabha­rata differs from Ramayana in a basic sense in so far as the later depicts the conflicts of the Aryans and non-Aryans,
            the former is a story of conflict between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, both Aryan people.
